Running the Anchor Web Service
------------------------------

The web component is tailored to our specific use.
Your mileage may vary, and you may need to adjust
some of the timeout and memory constants in 
the python and anchor scripts.


* To start the server:

```
python3.7 -u server.py -t 8080
```

Then connect to http://localhost:8080


* It should be set up, but to install the editor and
  create the web pages from scratch.  You can use the base
  ACE implementation too -- you just won't get the Anchor
  hilighting.

```
git clone https://github.com/stephenfreund/ace.git
cd ace
git checkout master
npm install
node Makefile.dryice.js full --target ./build
make
```
